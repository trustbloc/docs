## What is TrustBloc?

An interoperability initiative aimed at establishing common standards and
development frameworks for next generation digital identity networks.

## Why use TrustBloc?

Several projects exist today with the goal of creating digital identities that would allow everyday
users to have self-governance over the storage, distribution and control of their identity.
However many of these solutions are only offered partially and may not integrate well with each other.

TrustBloc provides the end-to-end architecture that enables the deployment of a production-ready
digital identity platform.
